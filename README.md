# README

Hello Reviewer!

I'm going to give this a narative style so it is easy to follow.

First, I'm going to setup the project by including the gems I like:
- rspec, factorybot: for tests
- httparty, vcr, webmock: for api testing 

Then I'll get a basic request test that submits the address and zipcode. 
Since the zipcode will be used for the cache key, I would try to negotiate with the project manager to have that be the only input for the first iteration. The address can be added next, and I will add that if I have time.
